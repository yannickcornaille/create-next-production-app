This is a production-grade [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) starter kit bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).\
create-next-production-app is designed to build a production-grade project using the Next.js framework.

It comes with various configurations and various tools to meet very common needs and use cases with the aim of providing a ready-to-use environment.

### Overview of available tools and configurations

- Runtime type checking with [prop-types](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types)
- [Module aliases](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for unit testing
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for E2E and integration testing
- JS and CSS linters and code formatter with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Git hooks with [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) and a first pre-configured pre-commit hook
- Internationalization with [next-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/next-i18next)
- PWA ready with [next-pwa](https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for developing, testing and documenting in isolation
- VSCode settings and launchers (run and debug)
- Dev container for VSCode and GitHub Codespaces

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api). This endpoint can be edited in `src/app/api/route.js`.

## Develop using a dev container

The easiest way to enjoy a fully featured development environment is to run the project locally in a container in VSCode or remotely in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=578278026).\
Check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces) for more details.
